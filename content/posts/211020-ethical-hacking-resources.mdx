## Installing GNOME Desktop Environment (Arch)

If you are logged in as *root* there is no need to use *sudo* to run these commands. This guide assumes you are logged in as root, if you aren't ensure to use sudo to grant root privileges. 

### Step 1 - Upgrade your System
Run the following command to upgrade your system to the latest version.

    # pacman -Syu
Reboot to apply any updates.

    # reboot
### Step 2 - Install Xorg or X Windows System

Install X Window System using the following command.

    # pacman -S xorg xorg-server
Press `Enter` to confirm installations for all of the modules listed.

When prompted, type in Y and press Enter to confirm that you want to install the aforementioned packages.

### Step 3 - Install the GNOME Desktop Environment
Install the GNOME desktop environment using the following command.

    # pacman -S gnome
Press `Enter` again to select all of the modules listed.

If you are missing any dependencies, GNOME offers a choice of provider. For each prompt that is presented, select the appropriate provider and press `Enter` to confirm the download.

When you are prompted, type in Y and press Enter to continue with the installation process. 
### Step 4 - Enable gdm.service (GNOME Display Manager)

Once GNOME has been installed, start the gdm service using the following command. This enables the GNOME GUI.

    # systemctl start gdm.service

Log in with the credentials given to you and open a new terminal window (`CTRL` + `ALT` + `T`).

Use the following command to automatically start the gdm service on system boot.

    # systemctl enable gdm.service

### Configure Display Manager (not required)
Install the appropriate Display Manager you would like to use. For this example we will use `SDDM`.

    # pacman -S sddm

When prompted, type in Y and hit Enter to continue.

Stop the gdm service by using:

    # systemctl stop gdm.service
    # systemctl disable gdm.service

Start the SDDM Display Manager by running (here we are configuring it so it starts at system boot):

    # systemctl start sddm.service
    # systemctl enable sddm.service

**Reboot your system to apply the changes.**

    # reboot
### Optional Commands

If you'd like you can install some software with your new Arch Linux system.

    pacman -S firefox vlc leafpad

The aforementioned command will install the Firefox web browser, VLC Media Player and Leafpad text editor.
